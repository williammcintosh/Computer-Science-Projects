Program 4 is designed to be a feed for job postings.
In this program, the user can insert postings into the data structure,
either manually, or from the txt files (which represent various information sources.

The data structure here is a BST, and each node has an array to store collisions.
Information is stored based on an integer called "priority" defined by the user.
